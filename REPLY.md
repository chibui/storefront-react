# Storefront Single-Page App

Thanks guys for the opportunity. It was quite a challenge and awesome experience.

First off I'll like to mention that this is my first attempt at React. I felt that given that the checkout team is moving towards React, I should try and demonstrate my ability to learn quickly and put what I've learn to use.

### Things I would improve on.

* Unit testing
* Add the breadcrumbs components
* break down components to smaller units    
* Refactor code 
    * Ensure best practices are used
    * make sure code is DRY, with less repetition
* Create more reusable components like buttons
* fix bugs
    * Issue with cart not instantiating properly which causes first click to not add an item.
    * state issues where removing a cart time if doesnt refresh the child component. Implementing redux might help with state issues.

## To serve the app, run
```
npm start
```
